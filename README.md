# FizzBuzz

## What is this project?

This program displays every integer from 1 to 100. The program uses a feature in java called a "for loop" to run the program 100 times, with the number being displayed increasing each time. If the number is divisble by 3, instead it will display the word "Fizz". If the number is divisible by 5, instead it will display the word "Buzz". If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it will instead display "FizzBuzz".
